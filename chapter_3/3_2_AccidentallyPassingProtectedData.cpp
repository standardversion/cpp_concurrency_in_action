/*
the code in process_data looks harmless enough, nicely protected
with std::lock_guard, but the call to the user-supplied function func means that
foo can pass in malicious_function to bypass the protection and then call
do_something() without the mutex being locked.
Fundamentally, the problem with this code is that it hasn’t done what you set out
to do: mark all the pieces of code that access the data structure as mutually exclusive. In
this case, it missed the code in foo() that calls unprotected->do_something().
Unfortunately, this part of the problem isn’t something the C++ Thread Library can
help you with; it’s up to you as programmers to lock the right mutex to protect your
data. On the upside, you have a guideline to follow, which will help you in these cases:
Don’t pass pointers and references to protected data outside the scope of the lock, whether by
returning them from a function, storing them in externally visible memory, or passing them as
arguments to user-supplied functions.
